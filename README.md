## How to Run:  
Compiling/Running the program  
0. OPTIONAL test file included with pre-existing values for search test case 7 along with load function testing  
1. Open the terminal within the src (NOT eportfolio project folder) folder  
2. Use the command "javac eportfolio/Portfolio.java"  
3. Then run the command "java eportfolio/Portfolio" or run the command "java eportfolio/Portfolio filename.txt" for sample file (file must be consistent with load/save format) 
4. From there it will start the program.

## Program Description:

	An investor often needs to maintain a portfolio of different investments so that the person
can keep track of the actions for buying or selling investments, searching for relevant
investments, updating prices, and calculating the total gain of the portfolio. An investment is
better modeled by an object so that you can distinguish different attributes and apply suitable
methods for accessing and changing these attributes. For this project, we limit ourselves to two
kinds of investments: Stock and MutualFund. With all searching and organziing being done through file I/O
and the use of the hashmap data structure and library.

## Future Improvements:  
For future improvements I would like to have had more knowlege in java contained libraries along
with having more prior practice with hash maps. I believe with these two improvement I would have been
able to make my code more efficient and concise resulting in easy to read and organized code. Although my code
may do all given tasks within the assignment I would like to have been able to also make my code more modular 
to remove as much redundancy as possible. Overall I believe I did a good job and all room for improvements
would so that I end up as a better/more organized programmer.
