## Program Description:

An investor often needs to maintain a portfolio of different investments so that the person
can keep track of the actions for buying or selling investments, searching for relevant
investments, updating prices, and calculating the total gain of the portfolio. An investment is
better modeled by an object so that you can distinguish different attributes and apply suitable
methods for accessing and changing these attributes. For this project, we limit ourselves to two
kinds of investments: Stock and MutualFund. With all searching and organziing being done through file I/O
and the use of the hashmap data structure and library
